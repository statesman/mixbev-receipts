    "# Mixed beverage data problems\n",
    "\n",
    "This file outlines problems I've seen with the identification of 2017 [Mixed Beverage Gross Receipts](https://comptroller.texas.gov/taxes/mixed-beverage/receipts.php) files posted by on the Texas Comptroller's [data center](https://comptroller.texas.gov/transparency/open-data/search-datasets/).\n",
    "\n",
    "All through 2015 and 2016, the Mixed Beverage Tax Receipts have been posted using a specific naming convention that made sense in relation to their due date, quoting [online documentation](https://comptroller.texas.gov/taxes/mixed-beverage/receipts.php): the **\"20th day of the month following the end of each calendar month (for example, April 20 for March activity)\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, soon after the 20th, a file would be posted:\n",
    "- The file name represented the month of its due date. For example, the receipts that were submitted for the April 20th, 2016 due date had a file name of MIXEDBEV_04_2016.CSV\n",
    "- The contents of that file mostly contain receipts form the previous month. So, the April 2016 file would have mostly receipts from March 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beginning in 2017, the file posting to Texas Comptroller site has not followed this same format, making it confusing in relation to other data. As I write this on Aug. 1, 2017, the files that are posted are named neither for their due date, nor the contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why does it matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "There is very little information about this data beyond a boilerplate file description that is the same for every month and a sparse [file layout](https://comptroller.texas.gov/auto-data/odc/MIXEDBEVTAX_LYOT.txt). This makes the title of the record and name of the file the only way the public can distinguish the record beyond the contents of the file itself. Open data as monthly government reports like this are often accessed through programming and APIs, and when basic naming conventions are not followed it can lead to errors and confusion for the public.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of historical use\n",
    "\n",
    "You can review how these files are named by viewing old one's by visiting the [data center](https://comptroller.texas.gov/transparency/open-data/search-datasets/) using a Chrome or Firefox browser and rolling your cursor over the CSV link to see the linked filename in the message window at the bottom of the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "![2017_data](../data_problem/dec2015_example.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "All the 2015 and 2016 files on the site follow the same pattern: The title of the file matches the month/year of the file name, which is the month of the due date of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of 2017 inconsistency\n",
    "\n",
    "With all the 2017 data, the title of the data has been changed to two months prior, when that date has nothing to do with the data. This file below was posted to the data portal on July 31, 2017, then renamed as 'MAY 2017' file. There is little reason to mark this file as May since the data is mostly June and the filing deadline was in July. It is confusing and inconsistent with a more relevant naming convention adhered to for two years in 2015 and 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "![2017_data](../data_problem/july2017_example.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendation and request\n",
    "\n",
    "Please return to the original title convention that matches the month the data is updated. Add records for the true January and February 2017 files, which are no longer listed on the portal."

    "## Programmatic look into Mixed Beverage Receipts file contents\n",
    "\n",
    "I suggest above to return to that the orginal file naming convention used in 2015 and 2016 because it references the due date of the reports, as outlined [by Comptroller reference documentation](https://comptroller.texas.gov/taxes/mixed-beverage/receipts.php).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because that due date is in the middle of the month, the contents of files uploaded from that due date most often reflect the prior month. Using at title three months prior to the due date, as is done with the 2017 files, is confusing and doesn't relate the actual data.\n",
